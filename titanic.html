                                Firstly, regarding the python distributions, <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/"
                                    target="_blank">Anaconda</a> has been used as specialized python distribution, which
                                comes with pre-installed and optimized python packages.
                                For the project, the latest available version of <a href="https://www.python.org/"
                                    target="_blank">Python 3.9</a> has been used. Documentation of all analyses has been

                                Short description of the Titanic challenge: as widely well known, Titanic is one of the
                                most infamous shipwrecks in history.
                                On April 15, 1912, the "unsinkable" Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg,
                                resulting in one of the deadliest shipwrecks.
                                While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it is likely that some
                                groups of people were having higher possibilities to survive than others.
                                In this challenge, the main question is defined as follows: <strong
                                    style="color:#df2344;">"What kind of people were
                                    more likely to survive?".</strong>
                                In this course, a couple of common data science practices were explained, regarding the
                                extraction of dataset by using techniques such as extraction from databases (sqlite3
                                library), through APIs (requests library) and web scraping (requests and BeautifulSoup
                                libraries).
                                In <a
                                    href="https://github.com/biljana-zobenica/titanic/blob/master/notebooks/1.0-bz-extract-titanic-data.ipynb"

                                This phase of the project covers some of the basic and advanced exploratory data
                                analysis techniques, such as basic data structure, summary statistics,
                                distributions, grouping, crosstabs and pivots. Also, here most of the time is invested
                                in terms of data cleaning, munging, visualization, using Python libraries
                                such as NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib. All these steps are documented in
                                <a href="https://github.com/biljana-zobenica/titanic/blob/master/notebooks/2.0-bz-exploring-processing-data.ipynb"

                            <p>Firstly, we import the Python libraries and as a common practice, we make their aliases. In
                                order to start the basic
                                exploratory
                                data analysis, we need to import the dataset, more precisely the train and test .csv files.

                                <p>Analysing the data structure,
                                    we can see some of the basic data-related info by using .info function, such as the number of data entries, columns,
                                    types of data,
                                    whether we have the missing data and memory usage of the dataframe. Having the separate train and test data, we
                                    concatenate these
                                    two dataframes into one dataset. After this, we have the data info as follows:
                                </p>
<div class="highlight">
    <pre>
<span class="c">  # concatenate the train and test dataset with pandas .concat method</span>

<span class="c">  # get some basic information of the dataframe with .info method</span>
  df<span class="s">.</span>info()
</pre>
    <pre>  &lt;class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'&gt; 

  Int64Index: 1309 entries, 1 to 1309 
  Data columns (total 11 columns):
   #   Column    Non-Null Count  Dtype  
  ---  ------    --------------  -----  
  0   Survived  1309 non-null   int64  
  1   Pclass    1309 non-null   int64  
  2   Name      1309 non-null   object 
  3   Sex       1309 non-null   object 
  4   Age       1046 non-null   float64
  5   SibSp     1309 non-null   int64

  dtypes: float64(2), int64(4), object(5)
  memory usage: 122.7+ KB </pre>
</div>

                                <p>So, in total, we have 1309 entries, 11 columns and data type information for each one in the dataset. Apparently, we
                                    have some missing data,
                                    which we will analyise and resolve in the proper way. In this step, we just explore the data by using simple
                                    functions as .head, .tail, slicing
                                    techniques, filtering with .loc. In this way, the basic overview of the data structure is gained.
                                </p>
<div class="highlight">
    <pre>

                                <br>
                                <p>Next, we analyse the summary statistics, depending on the type of the feature: numerical or categorical ones.
                                    For numerical features, we analyse the centrality measures (mean, median) and dispersion measure (range,
                                    percentiles, variance, standard deviation).
                                    For categorical features, we analyse the total and unique count, category counts and proportions, as well as per
                                    category statistics.
                                    By using .describe functions, including the argument 'all', we get <strong>the summary statistics</strong> of
                                    all features, as follows:
                                </p>

                                    For numerical features, we can analyse the centrality and dispersion measures. Whereas, the categorical ones
                                    need to be analysed in a different way. Take for example the feature of <strong>Pclass</strong>, which represents
                                    the class of the passanger. The graph below represents the number of passengers, categorized by the class 1st, 2nd or 3rd.

                                    Obviously, we can make a clear conclusion that the highest number of passengers were in the lowest class.

                                    By creating <strong>a crosstab</strong> and presenting it with a bar plot, using pandas library, also applying it to
                                    the <strong>Pclass and Sex</strong> features,
                                    we drive the additional conclusion that the majority of passangers in the third class are the male passangers,
                                    exactly number of 493. It is a very handy
                                    EDA technique, but its extension would be creating pivots. With pivots, we can add an argument of a function to be
                                    applied on a specific feature.

                                    Furthermore, we would like to apply some visualization tools in order to further analyse <strong>the distribution of
                                        the data</strong>. In that case,
                                    in order to analyse one feature's distribution or <strong>an univariate</strong> distribution, we use histogram
                                    and/or kernel density estimation (KDE) plot.
                                    But, if we want to analyse <strong>a bivariate</strong> distribution or a distribution of two features, we use
                                    scatter plot for visualization. Analysing
                                    the distribution, we look into very important aspects of it, such as <strong>skewness and kurtosis</strong>. In real
                                    world, we could rarely find the normal distribution.
                                    But, it serves as a standard for all real distributions in terms of their variations as opposed to normal
                                    distribution.

                                <p>Looking at the histogram of the features <strong>Age and Fare</strong>, we can see positively skewed distributions or
                                    we have their mean values higher than the medians.
                                    In terms of Age, this means that 50% of the passangers are older than 28 years and the other half is younger than
                                    the median of 28 years. Also, the mean age is 29.88,
                                    so, it is slightly skewed in right, meaning there are majority of ages around median, but also longer tail in the
                                    left with some very old people, comparing
                                    them to the median, shifting the mean age to be slightly higher than the meadian. Similarly, with more positive
                                    distribution, logic could be applied in terms of Fare.
                                    Also, further analysis of box-plots will be done in the next sections of data munging and feature engineering.
